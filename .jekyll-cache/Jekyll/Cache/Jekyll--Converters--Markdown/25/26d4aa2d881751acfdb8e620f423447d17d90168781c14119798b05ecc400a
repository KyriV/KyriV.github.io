<p>Hi Iâ€™m Kyri, a Theatre and Events professional turned QA. I am self-taught, and have started my QA journey working through the uTest academy, studying for the ISTQB qualification, listening to podcasts such as The QA Lead, and engaging with the test community through blog posts, YouTube videos and anything else in between.</p>

<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>

<p>The first-hand experience of test cycles on uTest has made me a confident tester on both mobile and desktop devices. Iâ€™m now able to compile concise bug reports with accompanying screenshots, screen recordings and logs from the browser and device. I have got to grips with the software, understanding how the developer tools work in the browser and how to use simulators and retrieve device logs in Android Studio and XCode.</p>

<p>I also have a good grasp on the technical environment, and am familiar with agile working methodologies, workflow management applications like JIRA and version control software like Github. I also have basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve also been learning the theoretical knowledge to back up these practical skills. Studying for the ISTQB and going through the uTest academy has taught me how to write and execute test cases and carry out exploratory testing.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been really excited to apply some of these practical skills and theory to real projects on uTest. And Iâ€™m also really looking forward to applying these skills in my next job.</p>
